# My first ever AI project

## About this repo

This will be my repo where I will post my experience about learning *Artificial Intelligence* and *Machine Learning*.

## Projects

### First ML Neural Network

#### Problem

The idea for this problem was taken from the channel [giant_neural_network](https://www.youtube.com/@giantneuralnetwork), please check them out for more information :)

### Note from me

Since I am a first year computer science student (while writing this) I wanted to dip my feet in the field of AI and ML that I found very interesting.
The youtube channel that I took this problem from helped me greatly to understand the concept of ML, however I did hit some limitations because at the moment of writing this I only
have had experience with Calculus 1, and it was reccomended to also have knowledge in Linear Algebra and Multi Variable Calculus which I did not fully lack but certanly did not have a high level
understanding of. I will surely be coming back to this project after I finish my 2nd semester that is coming up (After my first academic year) equiped with Calculus 2 and Linear Algebra under my belt
to try to solve a more complex version of this problem. I will also try to get a better understanding of R, Matlab, and Python for better upcoming plots but as of right now I have found my self
occupied learning Vim, and advance Git; I also have had a problem with not having a laptop nor a pc for 2 weeks but I finally got a new laptop so I should get back on track :).
